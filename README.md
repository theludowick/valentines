# Valentine's Day Web App 💕

A fun and interactive Valentine's Day web app that asks "Will you be my valentine?" with a playful twist!

## Features

- 🐻 Cute bear character with animated heart
- 💖 "Yes" button that leads to a celebration page
- 🏃 "No" button that runs away from your cursor (you can't click it!)
- 🎨 Beautiful gradient backgrounds
- 📱 Fully responsive design
- 🎉 Animated celebration page with floating hearts

## How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload all files (`index.html`, `yes.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`)
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" and choose `main` branch
5. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`

## Files

- `index.html` - Main page with the Valentine's question
- `yes.html` - Celebration page when "Yes" is clicked
- `styles.css` - All styling and animations
- `script.js` - Interactive behavior for the "No" button

## How It Works

- The "No" button detects when your cursor gets close and moves away
- If you try to click it, it jumps to a random position on the screen
- The "Yes" button leads to a happy celebration page with animations

Enjoy and happy Valentine's Day! 💕
